# Hi, I'm GKart.

I am a 20-year-old systems engineering student, I live in Argentina and my native language is Spanish but I have enough knowledge of English to be able to have a fluent conversation, in addition to my studies I am also an android ROM developer for the following devices:

- **Samsung Galaxy A30 [a30]**

of which the first is the one to which I dedicate the most time, I feel the last one to which I spend the least
I am also the official maintainer of BananaDroid for Motorola Moto E5+.

In addition to Android development, I know some programming in Python and I plan to learn to program in C/C++ in the near future.
